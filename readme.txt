Artiss Code Embed (formally Simple Code Embed) provides a very easy and efficient way to embed code (JavaScript and HTML) in your posts and pages.

== Description ==

Artiss Code Embed (formally Simple Code Embed) allows you to embed code - JavaScript and HTML primarily - in a post. This is incredibly useful for embedding video, etc, when required. It cannot be used for server side code, such as PHP.

This plugin works for both posts and pages. However, for simplicity I will simply refer to posts - bear in mind that pages work in the same way.

**Options Screen**

To use first of all visit the options page. In the Administration menu, under the Settings section there will a new settings option titled "Code Embed". Click on this and an options screen will appear.

Code embedding is performed via a special keyword that you must use to uniquely identify where you wish the code to appear. This consist of an opening identifier (some that that goes at the beginning), a keyword and then a closing identifier. You may also add a suffix to the end of the keyword if you wish to embed multiple pieces of code within the same post. 

From this options screen you can specify the above identifier that you wish to use. By default the opening and closing identifiers are percentage signs and the keyword is `CODE`. During these instructions these will be used in all examples.

**Embedding**

To embed in a post you need to find the meta box under the post named "Custom Fields". If this is missing you may need to add it by clicking on the "Screen Options" tab at the top of the new post screen.

Now create a new custom field with the name of your keyword - e.g. `CODE`. The value of this field will be the code that you wish to embed. Save this custom field.

Now, wherever you wish the code to appear in your post, simply put the full identifier (opening, keyword and closing characters). For example, `%CODE%`.

If you wish to embed multiple pieces of code within a post you can add a suffix to the keyword. So we may set up 2 custom fields named `CODE1` and `CODE2`. Then in our post we would specify either `%CODE1%` or `%CODE2%` depending on which you wish to display.

Don't forget - via the options screen you can change any part of this identifier to your own taste.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `simple-code-embed` folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Under the Settings section of the administration menu there should now be a new option named "Code Embed". Select this option to set the default options.
4. Add the identifier code to the appropriate posts and pages where you wish the code to be embedded.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My code doesn't work =

If your code contains the characters `]]>` then you'll find that it doesn't - WordPress modifies this itself.

= What's the maximum size of the embed code that I can save in a custom field? =

WordPress stores the custom field contents in a MySQL table using the `longtext` format. This can hold over 4 billion characters.

= Which version of PHP does this plugin work with? =

It has been tested and been found valid from PHP 4 upwards.
